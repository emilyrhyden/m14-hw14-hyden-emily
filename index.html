        <strong>My name is Emily Hyden.</strong> I am a 25-year-old living and working out of San Francisco, California. I grew up in Gainesville, Florida and attended the University of Florida before spending a few years in New York City. I am an Aquarius, ENFP and Enneagram Type 8w7. My StrengthsQuest top 5 are Communication, Command, Connectedness, Activator, and Strategic. I really enjoy life and figuring out all of the little nuances of our humanity. I see all obstacles as mirrors built to make us look inward. I am an altruist and an optimist, even though sometimes that feels naive. I can't help but believe that the moral arc of the universe does, in fact, bend toward justice, and I want to devote my life to getting there. I won't spoil anything else - check out my other sections!

        <strong>I am passionate about politics and communications.</strong> A handful of odd jobs - from teaching high school algebra to working reception at a member's only club in NYC - led me to where I am now. I work at Emerson Collective, a philanthropy-meets-venture fund where we address the world's toughest problems with the brightest solutions. I work directly with the C-Suite, where I ensure every guest that comes through is treated to a memorable, thoughtful experience. hroughout my professional career, I've developed a sharp eye for operational detail and the ability to manage demanding situations effectively. I am deeply committed to driving successful outcomes and have a strong passion for creating effective communications to do so, which has inspired me to pursue a Master's in Mass Communications online at the University of Florida in my free time.

        <strong>I am a jack of all trades.</strong> I have an urge to learn and an unquenchable curiosity. Coupled with a pretty fearless willingness to try anything once, I've found myself drawn to and captivated by an array of seemingly random hobbies. My first and truest passion is music. As a young girl, I never stopped singing. Unfortunately, I was severely tone deaf, but years of flute playing trained my ear. I have played the flute for 12 years now. Throughout middle, high school, college, and onto amateur ensembles in both NYC and SF, I have never put this passion aside. I've also been fortunate enough to sing - a dream come true for my younger self. I was a singer for a band in college and even have a few songs on Spotify! Aside from music, I enjoy rock climbing, reading, writing, and cooking. Whenever I am not working or studying, you can always find me doing one of these things.
