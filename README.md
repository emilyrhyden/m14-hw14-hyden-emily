# Assignment 14: Use a CSS and JavaScript Framework to Add Interactivity to a Website

## Emily's Portfolio Website
This portfolio site showcases professional and personal highlights using Bootstrap 5 for a responsive and interactive experience.

## Bootstrap Features
### Carousel
Implemented to cycle through images significant to my personal and professional life, the Bootstrap Carousel enhances user engagement with auto-play functionality and manual controls. Images are fully responsive to fit any device.

### Accordion
The Accordion organizes content into expandable sections for my bio, experience, and hobbies, making information easily accessible without overwhelming users. Each section is linked from the navbar, allowing direct access with a click, improving navigation efficiency.

### Design and Implementation
The Carousel adds visual interest, while the Accordion manages detailed content, both ensuring the site is accessible on various devices. Navbar links to Accordion sections enable quick content access, enhancing user interaction and site functionality.
